            <p>I didn't always know I wanted to be a journalist, but sometimes I feel like I'm made for it. Reading and writing have been my passions since the day I learned them, but the communication aspect of journalism came a bit later. </p>
            
<p> Story about my life. voracious.</p>

<p>Day one of my Intro to Journalism course at the University of Florida felt like I'd come home. Everything the professor said spoke to me. Do I like to read and write all the time? Check. Do I love talking to strangers about (at times) intensely personal issues? Check. Do I like learning a little bit about everything under the sun? Check, check, check.</p>
