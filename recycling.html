            <h1>Recycling in Gainesville</h1>
            <h2>The trashy chronicles of what Gainesvillites do (and don't) toss.</h2>
        
        <p>It's ironic that recycling, something that represents one of the cleanest behaviors, can be such a dirty word.</p> 
            
            <p> Recycling rates in Alchua County are high - the highest in the state, to be exact. For the second year in a row, the county has reported the highest recycling rates in the state, according to a report by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection.</p>
                
<p>The report is recent but shows data from 2011. Shannan Reynolds, a department spokeswoman, said Alachua County has a 50 percent recycling rate, a full 5 percent higher than Lee, Brevard and Marion counties.
Reynolds credits the aggressive recycling rate to the inclusion of commercial waste in the recycling stream, which most counties don’t enforce.</p>
<p>“That’s really what it’s going to take, because it makes up about 67 percent of the total waste stream,” she said.</p>
<p>But commercial inclusion alone won't raise the rate. A concentrated effort from larger organizations, and minor ones, is needed to reach this goal.</p>
<p>At UF, we have organizations like Sustainable UF, with whom the univeristy has partnered with to achieve a goal of Carbon Neutrality by 2015. Carbon Neutrality is when the amount of carbon released is equal to the amount saved through carbon offsets or simply lowering emissions as a whole. Lessening the waste stream on campus is a simple way to cause less emissions to be created in the first place.</p>
<p>Dale Morris, the UF solid waste coordinator, said UF realizes the way to promote recycling on campus is to make it more convenient.
Over the last few years, almost every standalone trash can on campus has had a recycling bin added on.</p>
<p>However, Starbucks cups may not make up as much of UF’s waste stream as students may think.</p>
<p>“Most of the recycling we do on this campus has nothing to do with students,” Morris said. “If you looked at a pie chart of all the recyclables on campus, the sliver for bottles and cans is so small it’s almost nonexistent.”</p>
<p>They are certainly the most visible and expensive thing UF recycles, he said, but bottles and cans are only a tiny portion of the university’s waste stream.</p>
<p>UF recycled 5,472 tons of waste in 2012. Of that, about 2,000 tons were paper, about 1,800 were woody debris and about 450 were concrete. Bottles and cans made up a measly 164 tons of the grand total, Morris said.</p>
<p>Reynolds said recycling is one of the top ways to be more sustainable.</p>
<p>“It’s one of the easier things to do,” she said. “It can be done at home, at work or when you’re out on vacation.”</p>

                <p>However, the preceding video offers an interesting spin on the seemingly golden halo of recycling. </p>
            
<p> Companies that encourage recycling have always been hailed as groundbreaking and sustainable, but what if they are the problem? </p>

<p>Towards the end of the video, Badore brings up the idea of “Product Stewardship,” which is a topic that has been generating interest lately.</p>
<p>One of the more notable takes on the idea is within the book, Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things. Written by Micheal Braungart, a renowned German chemist, and William McDonough, a famous American designer, the book explores the system of waste and product generation in the world today, as well as possible solutions to each of the issues presented.</p>
            
<p> Books and videos such as these offer burgeoning environmentalists the opportunity to look deeper into seemingly simple issues. In my opinion, this is the way to make sustainability an effective way of looking at the world.</p>
            
<p>Going beyond the simple answers and finding the root of the problem solves many smaller issues, and well as the major ones. If everyone viewed sustainability with the same thought process as this, I have no doubt that the impending issue of climate change would be on a much shorter path to resolution.</p>
